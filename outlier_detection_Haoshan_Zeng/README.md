The design of the framework of Ladder network of this WipeHero project borrowed much from https://github.com/abhiskk/ladder/tree/master/ladder 

To run this project:

1. A WipeHero Car algorithm test dataset in HDF5 file is needed, you can find this file named as 'data-2.h5' or you can create your own dataset via using 'Data_Loading _V2.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook.
2. run ladder.py in IDE
